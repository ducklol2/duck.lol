        <h2>Server pushed notifications to a PWA (works on iOS!)</h2>

        <p>
          I love the idea of PWAs (progressive web apps,
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps"
            target="_blank"
            >MDN</a
          >): develop & debug like a website, no app store, works (...mostly)
          everywhere. Of course, there are some limitations, and each platform
          works slightly differently, but it still seems like a nice way to
          create simple apps that don't use too many APIs (or prototype them, at
          least). I spent a day figuring out how to get a PWA working in iOS,
          create notifications, and to trigger notifications from the server.

          Code, and instructions to run it yourself:

          My first thing! I've been playing with random things in Docker
          containers on random local devices recently, but I didn't like using
          IPs, or ports, or managing DNS servers, or adding DNS entries to all
          my clients. I love how Traefik configures itself based on Docker
          compose labels, so I made a tool that does the same thing, but for
          using mDNS to publish `.local` addresses:

          I swear that I looked around for something like this prior to building
          it myself, and somehow I didn't find anything - but turns out many
          others have built something similar. Check them out too, see what
          makes sense to you!
